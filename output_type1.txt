The trial was constituted with sixteen test entries and two check varieties namely JRO 204 and JRO 524 and conducted over six locations i.e., Coochbehar, Kalyani, Katihar, Kendrapara, Nagaon and Rahuri. Location wise results are discussed below and fibre yield data are presented in table [Your Table]
Coochbehar: The trial was sown on 05.04.2021 at this centre and harvested on 06.08.2021 when the crop was 123 days old. Significant difference was observed among entries.Test entry BROJ-2 (29.69 q/ha) recorded highest fibre yield followed by JROBA-7 (28.34 q/ha), BROJ-1 (28.3 q/ha) and JROP-6 (26.92 q/ha) over the best check JRO 524 (25.52 q/ha) and JRO 204 (24.11 q/ha).
